Inappropriate ADH Syndrome,MESH:D007177,DO:DOID:3401,"A condition of HYPONATREMIA and renal salt loss attributed to overexpansion of BODY FLUIDS resulting from sustained release of ANTIDIURETIC HORMONES which stimulates renal resorption of water. It is characterized by normal KIDNEY function, high urine OSMOLALITY, low serum osmolality, and neurological dysfunction. Etiologies include ADH-producing neoplasms, injuries or diseases involving the HYPOTHALAMUS, the PITUITARY GLAND, and the LUNG. This syndrome can also be drug-induced.",MESH:D010900|MESH:D014883,C10.228.140.617.738.320|C18.452.950.626|C19.700.490,C10.228.140.617.738|C18.452.950|C19.700,"ADH Syndrome, Inappropriate|Antidiuretic Hormone, Inappropriate Secretion|Inappropriate Vasopressin Secretion Syndrome|Schwartz Bartter Syndrome|Schwartz-Bartter Syndrome|SIADH|Syndrome, Inappropriate ADH|Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH (SIADH) Secretion|Syndrome, Schwartz-Bartter",Endocrine system disease|Metabolic disease|Nervous system disease
Chondroblastoma,MESH:D002804,DO:DOID:2649,"A usually benign tumor composed of cells which arise from chondroblasts or their precursors and which tend to differentiate into cartilage cells. It occurs primarily in the epiphyses of adolescents. It is relatively rare and represents less than 2% of all primary bone tumors. The peak incidence is in the second decade of life; it is about twice as common in males as in females.
